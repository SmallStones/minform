minform is a jQuery plugin that takes a minimalistic approach to enhancing
forms. It aims for:

 - minimal markup: HTML5 form attributes
 - minimal code: leaning on jQuery to do the heavy lifting
 - minimal UI: subtle hints rather than explicit instructions

Features
========

placeholders
------------

<input placeholder="sometext">

You need to style "placeheld" inputs yourself. A good default is:

.placeheld {
  color: #A0A0A0;
  font-style: italic;
}

autofocus
---------

<input autofocus>

Automatically focuses the element on document.ready.

required
--------

<input required>

Will block form submission and focus the required element if it's not been
filled in.
